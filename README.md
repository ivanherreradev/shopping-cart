# Responsive React-Sass Shopping Cart with React Context

This project is a fully responsive shopping cart built using React and Sass, with the added benefit of React Context for efficient state management. The shopping cart enables users to explore a wide range of products and seamlessly add them to their cart. Before initiating the project, a visually appealing and user-friendly design was created on Figma. Moreover, the shopping cart's state and selected products are preserved using local storage, ensuring a consistent and pleasant shopping experience across different devices and sessions.

### Features:

- Responsive Design: The shopping cart is designed to be responsive across various screen sizes and devices. Whether users access the website on a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone, the cart interface adapts gracefully, ensuring an optimal shopping experience.

- Adding Products to the Cart: With a simple click, users can conveniently add products to the shopping cart. React Context effectively manages the cart state, making the process smooth and efficient.
  
- Opening and Closing the Cart: The shopping cart can be easily opened and closed with a user-friendly toggle button. This feature allows users to view the cart contents without leaving the current page, providing a seamless shopping experience.

- Modifying Cart Contents: When the cart is open, users can effortlessly add or remove products, and the cart summary updates in real-time. React Context efficiently handles these changes, maintaining a seamless flow.

- Local Storage Integration: The shopping cart's state, along with the selected products, is automatically saved in the local storage. This feature allows users to return to their cart at a later time without losing their selected items, even if they close the browser or navigate away from the site.

### Technologies and Tools used

- React: The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture ensures a modular and maintainable codebase.
  
- Sass: The project utilizes Sass, a powerful CSS preprocessor, to keep the styling organized, reusable, and easy to manage.
  
- React Context: The cart's state management is efficiently handled through React Context, eliminating the need for prop drilling and enabling seamless communication between components.
  
- Figma: Before commencing the project, a detailed design was created on Figma, ensuring a visually appealing and intuitive user interface.
